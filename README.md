Artificial intelligence algorithm using an evolucionary approach. is a pwa that saves the genomes in firebase database on every generation. The learning is saved on cloud. So every execution learning is notified and used on every device that is executing the algorithm. When you execute the game offline the data is also updated when there is an internet connection.

To execute the game just clone the code and open index.html or go to [https://ml-a1bd3.firebaseapp.com/](https://ml-a1bd3.firebaseapp.com/)

The code is based on the work done by [Gabriel Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.com)
